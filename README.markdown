You're welcome to use it, all code is MIT licensed by Tim Caswell <tim@creationix.com>

I intend for this to be a collection of high quality software that I use in my verious personal projects.

I do not, however, feel any obligation to fix issues for others who use it.

Like the MIT license says, you can freely use this software, but it comes with zero warrenty.
